BlueRange is a WiredScoreÂ® certified solution for the wireless communication of sensors and actuators in buildings and the digital foundation of building automation. Instead of conventional cabling, the BlueRange-ready components communicate wirelessly [via the particularly efficient BlueRange Mesh](https://github.com/bluerange-io/bluerange-mesh).

- **Transparent**: Stay on top of your buildings' key metrics, for example, to improve your ESG reporting.
- **Efficient**: Let your mesh devices communicate efficiently for decentralized room automation
- **Intelligent**: By adapting to the needs of your tenants, the building consumes only what is actually needed. This saves energy and money.
